How to Use
Upon successful completion of the Mazoga the Orc questline, if you have gained Mazoga's favor and both of you have become Knights of the White Stallion, Mazoga will become available as a Companion. Speak with Mazoga to find a new dialog option, "Let's work together." This will make Mazoga your companion and she will begin following you and fighting by your side!

The mod features a robust dialog based system for interacting with Mazoga and managing her items. While Mazoga is your companion, speak with her and say "We need to talk" to discuss equipment. You will then have the option to either take Mazoga's current items or GIVE her your current equipment. This allows you to give Mazoga the exact loadout you want by equipping it on yourself first.

If you are tired of Mazoga, you can ask her to "Wait here" and she will remain in the current location. If you want Mazoga to stop being your companion, ask her to wait then speak to her again and say "Let's stop working together". Mazoga will automatically return to the White Stallion Lodge and resume her vanilla behavior.
