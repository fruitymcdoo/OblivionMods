EnchantmentMasteryCustom is a custom version of the mod EnchantmentMastery by olegbl.

This version of the mod fixes a number of issues as well as some memory/variable leaks that could lead to corrupted saves.

This custom version also includes the ability to enchant Quest Items while retaining their Quest Item status.

I have attempted to contact the original creator unsuccessfully, so I cannot post this on Nexus Mods.
